### *Forging Better Tech, Becoming Better Humans.*

**Project Sharanga** is a dedicated initiative focused on relentless improvement. It is a space where we obsess over refining our skills, growing through learning, and ultimately becoming better people through the craft of engineering.

We are here to **solve real problems** with **technology.**

### 💡 Our Obsessions

We don't just write code; we adhere to a philosophy:

* **Minimalism** 🍃 – Removing the noise to find the signal.
* **Simplicity** ⚪ – Complexity is the enemy of security.
* **Real-World Impact** 🌍 – Solving actual problems, not imaginary ones.
* **Great Tech** ⚡ – Built to last, built to perform.

### 🛡️ The North Star: Digital Sovereignty

Our ultimate destination is **Digital Sovereignty**. We aim to build software with a single guiding principle: **Privacy by Design.**

We recognize that perfect security is a journey, not a destination. However, we are committed to these non-negotiable truths:

> **🔒 Privacy is a Right, Not a Luxury**
> You should never have to pay extra to be safe. Security is the baseline, not the upgrade.
>
> **👤 You are the Owner**
> The data you create belongs to you. Not us, not our servers, and definitely not advertisers.
>
> **🚫 Data is Not a Commodity**
> We refuse to view user data as an asset to be mined, sold, or bartered.

We may not be able to solve every problem in the tech industry, but in this corner of the internet, **you are the only owner of your digital life.**
